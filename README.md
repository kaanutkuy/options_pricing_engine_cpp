How to Run the Pricer?
Build and run the "main.cpp" file, and follow the directions. It will prompt you to create an option by specifying the type of option, and the qualities of the option, and then it will ask for a name to store the option object in memory. When you create it, you can retrieve the option's price, and depending on the type of it, the Greeks as well.
